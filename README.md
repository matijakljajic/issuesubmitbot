Facilitating the submission of issues on GitHub by establishing a seamless connection between the end-user and the platform itself.

By providing a custom form that is specific to the user's program, this program enables the end-user to submit a GitHub issue swiftly and conveniently. This process is particularly useful for individuals who do not use GitHub and for those who wish to remain anonymous.

## Guidelines (*will update*)
1. Make your custom form which will provide the data.
2. Proceed to feed the bot with the said data.
3. Bot will do it's job through the use of the [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest).
4. Issue created, plain and simple.
