# Issue Submit Bot
Making issue submitting on GitHub easier through the use of a bot which would act as a "middle-man" for submitting issues.

## Perks that come with the bot:
People who don't want to make a GitHub account can now post issues no problem.

People who want to keep their anonymity when posting issues can now do so with ease.
